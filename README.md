# SwiftUI-Slots
This is reporsitory for a game project that I made using SwiftUI in XCode.
Different branched represent my progression through the app and the different elements added to the game.
The app consists of a simple interface with a title, credit score, icons and a button.
When the button is clicked, the icons are randomised. If 2 or more icons match, the credit score increases. If no icons match, the score decreases.
